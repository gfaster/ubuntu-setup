# ubuntu-setup
My ubuntu setup script, made for setting up a new ubuntu installation
I still haven't tested this so it's gonna be up to future me

## Manual steps still needed:
- set colorpack, icons, and window manager theme in xfce
- remap super-up to maximize
- probably more git gcm setup
- 1password ssh credential manager
- setup for programs such as 1password, thunderbird, firefox
